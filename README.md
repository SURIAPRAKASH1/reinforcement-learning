# Reinforcment Learning:

- Implementation of Classical tabular and function approximation methods to advanced policy gradient methods like PPO (from open ai), GRPO (from deepseek). Every algorithm capture core concept for understanding.

# Classical:

## Tabular Methods:

    - Monte Carlo Methods
    - Temporal Difference-TD(0)
    - n-step bootstrapping

## Functoin approximation:

    - Gradient Monte Carlo Method
    - Semi-Gradient TD(0)
    - Semi-Gradient n-step bootstrapping
